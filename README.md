# seng

## Overview

The purpose of the seng project is to provide a starting point for video game projects that are targeting multiple platforms.  The design principles are as follows.

- Strike a balance between keeping the architecture simple and minimizing the amount of platform specif code.
- Show how to orgainze a project to build for multiple platforms.
- Design for a specific project; don't build too much in the way of generic infrastructure for other projects.

The name ''seng'' comes from ''simple engine'', but this is a misnomer according to the third design principle.
